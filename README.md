# gh-branches-ex-2

Awesome websites have asked your team to develop their website. 

A skeleton has been made, it is your job to fill it in. 

There are three pages and five features. 

The pages are;

1. Home (index.html)
2. About (/pages/about.html)
3. Contact (/pages/contact.html)

There are five feature branches premade;

1. feature/header
2. feature/home
3. feature/about
4. feature/contact
5. feature/footer

To add to a feature, make a branch from the permanent feature
branch. The naming convention for these branches are as follows;

    enhancement/header_title_menu_mz (where mz are your own initials)

These branches MUST NOT be merged with main. To follow the correct
strategy, merge your own branch with the specific feature branch. 
This can then be merged with main.
